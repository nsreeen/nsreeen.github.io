Today I pair programmed with Chhavi on a DSL for creating scenes out of images!  We wrote it in Javascript so we could render our scenes in the browser, which was a lot of fun.

We allow a user to input only one expression at a time.  So each expression is evaluated in isolation, but it's output (effect on the scene) is cumulative.  

This later sent me on a bit of a wormhole try and understand context free grammars vs context sensitive grammars.  I'm still trying to understand this, but one thing that I found pretty cool is that these ideas came from studying natural languages.
