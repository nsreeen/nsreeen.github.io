Today I read a bit about how shells work.  The neatest thing was that whenever a command is executed a new process is created to run that command, BUT when the command is `cd` it has to be executed in the shell's process.  That's because the working directory is stored as part of the process's state - updating it has to be done with a system call, and that can only be done from inside the shell's process itself.

I also attended a cool pair programming workshop, and worked with Sophia to write a wordle in javascript & html.  It was really fun!  I haven't made an interface for anything in ages so it was really cool to do that, and I learnt some bits of Javascript syntax.
