Today I made a bit more progress on my shell!  I can now change directory, make other system calls, and run multiple commands (separated by `&&`).  

I started working on implementing pipes (`|`) and learnt some cool stuff:

- file descriptors are unique IDs for open files in a process.  Each process has a table of file descriptors for currently open files and uses those IDs to operate on the files.  Shells use file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 for stdin, stdout, and stderr, respectively
- /proc is a virtual file system with a bunch of info about what's happening in the kernal THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT (eg `ls /proc`)
- `ls -l /proc/self/fd` prints the file descriptors table in the current process

Today I also got to meet a few more people and had some really interesting chats, paired with Sophia on some environment setup stuff, and attended a really excellent debugging workshop run by Julia.
