Today I started working on a small calendar app - it gets the events I'm subscribed to from the RC calendar API and displays them.  

I had a chat with Julian early in the day about both of our projects - it was really interesting hearing about his, and it helped me plan out mine.

Later in the day I pair programmed with Angel - they helped me process the data being received and showed me how to apply a bunch of css styles (and make the html look really cool!).  It was very satisfying seeing the page transform and come together.

I used fastapi for the API - this is the first time I've used it and I found it indeed very fast to get set up.  I'm currently calling the API from a HTML page with embedded javascript, though I may change that at some point.  I'd ultimately like to be able to add additional calendar events and shade out the times I'm not online, so I can share the page with others.
