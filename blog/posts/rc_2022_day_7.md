I continued working on my calendar app today: now events can be added to the service, stored in a sqlite database, and added events are combined with the RC events to be rendered by the front end.  

I pair programmed with Isaac for the first part of the day to add and store events which was a lot of fun!  We ended up having to deal with some config issues before we could make the changes we wanted to make.  I think I would have found that a bit demotivating if I'd been working alone, but instead I really enjoyed the time we spent working on it.

Relatedly, I chose this project because I wanted to use it and I thought it would be a good project to pair program on (which is my main goal this week).  I have been pair programming on it, and I'm still hoping to be able to use it.  But I've been thinking that once I wrap this project up I want to do something that I am motivated to do for itself, not the result.

I attended a really excellent workshop run by Rachel today which cemented that desire - it was about 'building volitional muscles'.  I got a lot clearer on why I want to do certain projects, which made it a lot easier to see which I'm most excited about and want to prioritise.

I also got to have great chats with Jackson and Sophia about projects we're each working on.
