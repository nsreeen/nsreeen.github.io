I spent most of today continuing working on my calendar service in Kotlin and also made some changes to the front end, which involved learning a bit about `Date`s in Javascript.  

A Javascript `Date` object is basically a wrapper around a number representing the milliseconds [since 1 January 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), so it holds information about a date & time.


We can see this if we initialise a new Date:

```javascript
date = new Date()
date.valueOf()
```
outputs: `1661370033502`


`Date` doesn't support different time zones - all `Date`s are in UTC.  However, when converted to a string the time is converted to the user's browser time zone:

```javascript
date.toString()
```
outputs: `Wed Aug 24 2022 20:40:33 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)`


I think this is pretty neat - rendering in the user's time zone is really useful, and this seems like the exact amount of date/time & time zone functionality needed for the browser.
