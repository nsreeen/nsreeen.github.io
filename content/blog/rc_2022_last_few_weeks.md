I spent weeks 10 and 11 working through the [Rustlings exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) and working on my [Wikidegrees](https://github.com/nsreeen/wikidegrees/) project (which I wrote in Rust).  I found Rustlings to be a cool way to learn some Rust and I also really enjoyed using Rust for a project.  I learnt some cool things like Rust's [collect method](https://nsreeen.github.io/blog/rc-2022-rusts-collect/), and how to write [async code](https://nsreeen.github.io/blog/rc-2022-wikidegrees/).  

In week 12 I started turning my small Haskell interpreter into a full [lisp](https://github.com/nsreeen/hasp) - something I hope to finish after my batch.  I also spent a lot of time chatting to people and thinking about the last 12 weeks.  

Returning to the Recurse Center for a second batch has been a really positive but also intense experience.  I think I'll write more about it once I've had more time to reflect on the experience.
