I took a break from writing, so I wanted to write a catch up post about what I've been doing.

- I spent a lot of week 5 and today (week 7 day 1) finishing up my [calendar app](https://nsreeen.github.io/calendar2) and deploying it.

- In week 6 I had a lot of fun doing some p5js sketches (by myself and collaboratively).  I put some of them [here](https://jovial-brioche-bf034a.netlify.app/).

- Throughout the last two weeks I've been pair programming a lot - this has been great!  I got to work on a bunch of things I wouldn't have done otherwise

- I've also been thinking about how I want to spent the last part of my batch.  In some ways I felt a bit unfocussed over the last two weeks.  It was great to try new things - via pair programming and the p5js sketches.  I'm feeling a lot more focussed and ready for the last part of the batch now.
