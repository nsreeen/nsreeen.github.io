  RC 2022 Day 8 - Toki Pona and thoughts on blogging
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2022-08-17</strong></p>
<h2 id="translating-toki-pona">Translating Toki Pona</h2>
<p>Today I pair programmed with Ben on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">Toki Pona</a> to English translator - it was a lot of fun!</p>
<p>Toki Pona is a minimalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">contructed language</a>, that only has ~120 vocabulary words!  So a lot of words have multiple meanings (eg. <code>soweli</code> means animal, cat, dog, etc), and often multiple words are used to convey one meaning (eg. <code>jan pona</code>, literally &quot;good person&quot;, means friend).</p>
<p>I find the ambiguity and subjectivity of Toki Pona to be very charming, and it was a lot of fun to play with that with our translator.  We choose a random word when multiple translations are acceptable, which led to multiple iterations of a translation diverging.</p>
<p>We have a couple more grammar rules to add, I'll probably post some translations once we've finished.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-blogging">Thoughts on blogging</h2>
<p>I also had a really good coffee chat with Manuel today.  One of the things we talked about was blogging, which inspired me to think about my blogging practice.</p>
<p>One of my goals for my batch is to practice working in public, so I've been publishing a blog post every day.  This is going pretty well: I've been enjoying writing more and reflecting on what I'm doing day to day, I feel more comfortable publishing something less polished now, and I'm glad I'll be able to look back on this record of what I'm doing at RC.</p>
<p>The downside is that I often run out of time and end up writing when I'm already a bit tired.  I also feel some of the posts I'm publishing are a bit clunky or insubstantial.  I'm ok with quality issues, as the alternative might be zero posts.  I might stop posting every day though if it gets to be too much, but for now the slight time pressure is helping me be less precious about what I'm publishing.</p>
<p>One thing I've been struggling with is: am I writing a log of what I did today or a post inspired by what I did today?  I've been trying to strike a balance, but have perhaps been tending towards logging as it's more straightforward.  Going forward I think I'll try to write posts instead, even if they're short, and I'll stop noting everything I do.  I think that will be more interesting to write and read.</p>
